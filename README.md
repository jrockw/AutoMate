Please install the following before running our code:
1) googletrans (sudo pip install googletrans)
Note the project was written with Python 2.7

We have also used TKinter to make the GUI. Usually TKinter comes pre-installed with python. If you don't have TKinter, please install that too.

Since we use the googletrans API, you will have to be connected to the internet for our app to work.

To run our code, cd to the repository and execute "python GUI.py'. The values printed to the console are for testing purposes only. The GUI will pop up in a separate window. Please use the GUI only to interact with our app. Ignore anything in the console. It takes around 50 seconds for the data to train. The GUI is generated only after the data is trained. Please be patient!

ABOUT OUR PROJECT:

We have built a python app to help people who don't know English very well. Many times, bilinguals(good at native language, intermediate level at english) know the word they want to use in their native language, but don't know its English translation. There are also times when bilinguals would like to know what English word should come next. Our app gives the user suggestions in their native language and when the users select the word in their native language, the English word is inserted in the textbox.
