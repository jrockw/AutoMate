Talk to me
And I better not hear a word
Do me baby
I better not feel it girl
I still got one bullet left in my nine
Finna do a lovecrime
Lovecrime
Finna do a lovecrime

Murder murder murder she wrote
Lovecrimes
Lovecrimes
Murder murder murder she wrote
Lovecrimes
Lovecrimes

You write me love letters
With your fathers pen
If he knew the freaky, freaky things
That you write with it

Is it really wrong
That I want to be the babydaddy
Is that a lovecrime, lovecrime
Tell me it's a lovecrime

Murder murder murder she wrote
Love crimes love crimes
Murder murder murder she wrote
Lovecrimes lovecrimes
Murder murder murder she wrote
Lovecrimes lovecrimes

In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two...''''''''''''''''
