Look, maybe I should just be clear,
It sucks not having you here...
There ain't a better way to say it,
Other than how I just said it there...
Like a bottle of Avion you can see through me,
My ego ain't here...

So many clever words and nice things,
That I could say ... the truth then
And the truth now has been the same.

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying,
And the best way to say it, it is to just say it...
Wanna run away from the words,
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying...

Girl I love you... still...

I try to go some months without a call,
I mean I'm an attractive guy and all...
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
Maybe I can find something in the club,
Or something in the mall... mall... mall...
But them girls didn't matter and
This money ain't distracting me much at all...

I know some clever words and nice things,
That I could say... but the truth then

And the truth now have been the same... oh

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying,
And the best way to say it, it is to just say it...
Wanna run away from the words,
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying...
Girl I love you...

But girl I wanted to cry but I made it look easy...
To hold it in the same phase...
And it was harder to stay so I made it look easy...
To just get up and walk away...
Now I'm alone and the tears do fall, (they do fall)
Holding my mouth and the words do fall...
Now I'm standing here after all...
Broken heart, but I'm strong and hard...

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying,
And the best way to say it, it is to just say it...
Wanna run away from the words,
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying...
Girl I love you...
Still...''''''''''''''''
