I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complimenting you
You love attention from the big crowd

Feels like I'm on the sidelines
Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl
Who's this other guy that sending you these flowers
Oh now you tell me your ex is your best friend.

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with NO ONE
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

Greedy loveee x2
Oh my greedy love

The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when you're with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night

Feels like I'm ridin' the bench
Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You see my blown fuse cause everybody's on you

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with NO ONE
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

Greedy loveee x2
Oh my greedy love

Greedy loveee x2
Oh my greedy love

The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Tho it seems like I'm nagging oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask
When all I want is you to myself
To share with NO ONE
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

Greedy loveee x2
Oh my greedy love

Greedy loveee x2
Oh my greedy love''''''''''''''''
