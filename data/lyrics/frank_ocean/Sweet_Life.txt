The best song wasnt the single
But you werent either
Living in Ladera Heights
The black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise
Palm trees and pools
The waters blue swallow the pill

Keeping it surreal
Whatever you like
Whatever feels good
Whatever takes you mountain high
Keeping it surreal
Not sugar free my TV aint HD thats too real
Grape vine mango peaches and lime

A sweet life, a sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
A sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweety pie

Youve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world when you got the beach
Dont know why see the world when you got the beach
The sweet life

The best song wasnt the single
But you couldnt turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver
Cant seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting a wave
Youre catching that breeze
Till youre dead in the grave

But youre keeping it surreal
Whatever you like
Whatever feels good
Whatever takes your mountain high
Keeping it surreal
Not sugar free my TV aint HD thats too real
Grape vines mango peaches and lime 

A sweet life, a sweet life, a sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life, a sweet life
Live and die in the life

Youve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born, yeah
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world when you got the beach
Dont know why see the world when you got the beach

And the water is exactly what I wanted
Its everything I thought it'd be
But this neighborhood is getting trippier everyday
Neighborhood is going ape shit crazy

Youve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world when you got the beach
Dont know why see the world when you got the beach
Sweet life

Youve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world
When you got the beach
Dont know why see the world
When you got the beach
The sweet life''''''''''''''''
