She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She's thinking maybe the next one,
Should have something to do with you,
To do with me...

Oh ooh... oh okay well you gotta do mine in color...
Oh ooh... oh... Cause all of your exes are in black and white...

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know this love is gonna last,
And now we getting blasted... uh...
'Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself...
My feelings go deeper than the ink,
It goes deeper, deep in to your soul

She said you should get a rubix cube over your heart oh yeah
But you say I've already figured it out,
Already figured out the love...
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip ooh oh...
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we,
On each other,
Loving on each other,
Kissing on each other.

Oh ooh... oh okay well you gotta do mine in color...
Oh ooh... oh ...Cause all of your exes are in black and white...

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know this love is gonna last,
And now we getting blasted... uh...
'Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself...

My feelings go deeper than the ink,
It goes deeper, deep in... to your soul... (x2)

Paper to pen, Needle to skin
I'm in the chair, and she's over there...
Taking these pictures and blowing me kisses
When I ask her to hold my hand,
She told me to take that ink like man
Told me take that ink like a man (x2)
She told me that (yeah) (x2)

You wanna get blasted, (blasted)
Cause you know this love is gonna last,
And now we getting blasted (blasted)
'Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself...
My feelings go deeper than the ink,
It goes deeper, deep into your soul...

You know it.''''''''''''''''
