If a three fell in the forest,
And no one was around to hear it,
Baby, does it go 'boom'? Does it go 'boom'?
If I have love for ya,
But you weren't ever close enough to feel it...
Is my love any good? (x2)
Oh...

But the distance ain't even normal ayeee
You're laying in the bed right next to me,
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us,
Some soundproof glass and some bars in the middle...
Oh baby when I wanna talk to you,
I'm conversing with bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel...
And when I tap your shoulders,
You're cold as bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel...
And I've been questing your love
But you ravished all the the left over's and garbage
Was it ever real... If you were never here...
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen,
Like a pile of bricks and steel...
Bricks bricks, steel steel...

Oh I know you're somewhere in there...
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away...
Chiseling away... away...
Girl my phone bill is crazy,
The rate is sky high when I call ya...
But you only let it ring...
You only let it ring no oh...

But the distance ain't even normal ayeee...
You're laying in the bed right next to me,
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us,

Some soundproof glass and some bars in the middle...
Oh baby when I wanna talk to you,
I'm conversing with bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel...
And when I tap your shoulders,
You're cold as bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel...
And I've been questing your love
But you ravished all the left over's and garbage
Was it ever real... f you were never here...
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen,
Like a pile of bricks and steel...
Bricks bricks, steel steel...

Stop, stop, I think I hear 'em coming down the hall,
He don't hear a word I said oh,
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk... talk...

Oh, stop, stop, I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and
He don't hear a word I said oh, oh oh...

Oh baby when I wanna talk to you,
I'm conversing with bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel...
And when I tap your shoulders,
You're cold as bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel...
And I've been questing your love
But you ravished all the left over's and garbage
Was it ever real... f you were never here...
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen,
Like a pile of bricks and steel...
Bricks bricks, steel steel...''''''''''''''''
