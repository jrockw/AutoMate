Forever could never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now
We won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
And love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this caf
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Together could never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words
I love you and you're beautiful
Now that the wait is over
And love has finally showed her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this caf
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to
Sing to you
When all the music dies

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this caf
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm
Marry me''''''''''''''''
