And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today, way up high in the sky
And, oh, when the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine by taking our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never me

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today, way up high in the sky
And, oh, when the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine by taking our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise, and all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad, girl, the answer lies you with

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today, way up high in the sky
And, oh, when the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine by taking our time

Hey, oh
Well the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go and it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're going to see it spin, we're going to sail, leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh
My my my my my my yeah
Well, everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, oh, oh lord
Baby, baby, baby, oh.''''''''''''''''
