I don't mind lying if it stops the pain
There's no use denying, I've lost the train of thought
I had before I left, Now I'm alone
The place I left behind, had I known

I'm counting on you
I'm all around you
I'm counting on you to take me home

You sit back in your easy chair and tell me 'bout the whole affair
You say I'm gonna be something some day
It sounds so easy, the way you please me
Well you say I'm on the right track
But I think that it's time that I get back home

I'm counting on you
I'm all around you
I'm counting on you to take me home

Something in the wind ain't right
There's something on the faces in the streets at night
There is so much on my mind
Well you say it's here in front of me
But it's something I can't find no more

Something in the wind ain't right
There's something on the faces in the streets at night
There is so much on my mind
Well you say it's here in front of me
But it's something I can't find no more

I'm counting on you
I'm all around you
I'm counting on you to take me home''''''''''''''''
