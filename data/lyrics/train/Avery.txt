She holds his clothes in the dark
Rocking them she whispers
Her hand falls slowly from her neck
To her left a streetlight dances gently through a window
It hurts to say his name
She swears she can hear him calling her, hey Avery

There between her craving and imagination
It falls into the night
The air is still and he's still calling her, hey Avery
Is there room enough for me, it's been so long
Is there something you should say to me, Avery?

Pity drives him down, his candle burning out
She thought it was the answer
Her pity drives her down, her years are burning out
She thought it was the answer
Her cross still hanging in the corner
She's afraid to take it down

It reminds her she's gotta start life over
Hey Avery, Is there room enough for me, it's been so long
Is there something you should say to me, Avery?

Pity drives him down, his candle burning out
She thought it was the answer
Her pity drives her down, her years are burning out
She's dying from the answer

She wears his picture on a chain
She prays that the pain won't last forever
And I know that she's still praying
That the pain won't last forever
There between her craving and imagination
It falls into the night
The air is still and he's still calling her, hey Avery
Why wasn't there room enough for me?''''''''''''''''
