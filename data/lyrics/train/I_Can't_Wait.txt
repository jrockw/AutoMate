Put my coat in the closet, 
Sit on the edge of your bed
You don't look like your pictures anymore
You don't look quite the same
And I don't wanna stay long, really can't stay
Life awaits me

Your mother says you're doing better
Doesn't look that way to me
She says you've come so far so fast
Sure don't look that way to me
And I don't wanna stay long, 
Wish that I could stay
But life awaits me

And I can't wait for you

And our fathers have changed
And our mothers have changed
And our people have changed
And our seasons have changed
But you have not changed
And I don't know if you will ever change


Linda says she loves you, 
She sends her best
Along with all the rest
Bobby says he loves you, 
He can't take this test
And I don't wanna stay long, 
Don't think I can stay
Life awaits me

And I can't wait for you I can't wait

And our fathers have changed
And our mothers have changed
And our people have changed
And our seasons have changed
And my god has changed
And the seasons have changed
But you have not changed

Get my coat from the closet be back when I can''''''''''''''''''''''''
