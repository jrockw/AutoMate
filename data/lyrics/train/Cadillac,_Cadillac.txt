Hey baby

Cadillac, Cadillac take me home
I would rather sit there all alone
Then watch you run around this dance floor light
With everybody but me just ain't right
Cadillac, Cadillac take me home
I'd rather play games on my G4 phone
Than watch you flirt at the bar all damn night
With everybody but me girl it just ain't right

Right, what you do to a man falling all over you
Right, right what you say
Making me dance alone that way
Now I do what I can, but when it comes to women
I don't understand
So, I, I'm out of here
Call yourself a cab, watch my Cadillac disappear

Hey baby

Cadillac, burn the mac's on the tube
Think I'm gonna spend my night with you
She wouldn't know a good thing like I said
If I hit her from behind upside the head
Cadillac, do I lack what it takes?
Every time I love seems my heart breaks
I'd rather sit all night there see the outer space
Than lose another part of me to another pretty face
Right, what you do to a man falling all over you
Right, right what you say
Making me dance alone that way
Now I do what I can, but when it comes to women
I don't understand
So, I, I'm out of here
Call yourself a cab, watch my Cadillac disappear

Hey baby I'll be alright now
Hey baby I'll be alright now

Right, what you do to a man falling all over you
Right, right what you say
Making me dance alone that way
Now I do what I can, but when it comes to women
I don't understand
So, I, I'm out of here
Call yourself a cab, watch my Cadillac disappear

Hey baby
I'll be alright now, baby
Hey baby
I'll be alright now, baby''''''''''''''''''
