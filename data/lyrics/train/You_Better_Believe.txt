I wish that I had all the answers
And I could walk you down your road
For all the times those times you feel like you don't matter
There's just one thing you gotta know

You better believe, you better believe
Like my father said to me
"Just give it some time, look for a sign
And you'll be just fine"

They say that nothing lasts forever
They say that good times fade away
And I know, I know that sometimes it ain't easy
But I know you'll be okay

One day I'll see you in the future
You'll have a family of your own
I will be there, I will be there to be your teacher
You better believe, you better believe you're not alone

You better believe, you better believe
Like my father said to me
"Just give it some time, look for a sign
And you'll be just fine"

They say that nothing lasts forever
They say that good times fade away
And I know, I know that sometimes it ain't easy
But I know you'll be okay

You better believe
You better believe
You better believe no matter where you are
You better believe
You better believe
Even when you don't believe I won't be far

It's true that nothing lasts forever
We all become a memory
But I know, I know one day we'll be together
Together again, you better believe, you better believe

You better believe
You better believe
You better believe no matter where you are
You better believe
You better believe
Even when you don't believe I won't be far''''''''''''''''
