What good is Saturday if you're not here to say
I made you French toast and coffee come over
When ya coming back to California
Baby, I'm hungry

Your mail is piling up, I heard the weather's rough
I know your mama's going crazy, like always
Crying you a river like Salt Lake
Can't wait till Sunday

When you land I'll be waiting on the runway
Flowers in my hands, tears in my eyes

'Cause I was up all night
Thinking bout your homemade dishes
Fantasizing all those kisses
Oh and I was up all night
Thinking 'bout the lonely weekend
Monday baby we can sleep in
Ooh ooh ooh
Without you
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?

Hey, it's me again don't know how long it's been
I just sent you a picture of me and Rover
Ten emojis, hungover
Baby, I'm lonely

Think George is coming by to help me kill some time
I know you worry 'bout me when I'm with Lopez
Something always seems to get broken
I'll fix it on Sunday

When you land I'll be waiting on the runway
Flowers in my hands, tears in my eyes

'Cause I was up all night
Thinking bout your homemade dishes
Fantasizing all those kisses
Oh and I was up all night
Thinking 'bout the lonely weekend
Monday baby we can sleep in
Ooh ooh ooh
Without you
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
I don't know

Cartoons ain't funny no more
Cap'n Crunch tastes like cardboard
Keeping up with the FIFA scores
It's no fun without you

Oh and I was up all night
Thinking bout your so hot biscuits
Hope you know how much I miss it
Oh and I was up all night
Thinking 'bout the lonely weekend
Monday baby hope we can sleep in
Ooh ooh ooh
Without you
What good is Saturday?
What good is Saturday?
Oh baby
Oh baby
Nothing''''''''''''''''
