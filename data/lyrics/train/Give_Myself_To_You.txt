When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

Is this forever, this feeling I got
Not enough and too much - so free and so caught up
And something and nothing - both at the same
I'm either out of my head or I'm out of my mind

When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

Is this forever this feeling that I'm not moving at all
But I just can't stop
It's like I'm dreaming and I'm wide-awake too
Will you remember me? 'cause I won't forget you

When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do


When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

I guess I was saving my life for later
Maybe I should have been giving myself to you
Now I know I got to find out who I am before I do
Before I do

When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I know I'm gonna give myself to you

I'm gonna give myself to you
I'm gonna give myself to you'''''''''''''''''''
