You and I, we're friends from outer space
Afraid to let go
The only two who understood this place
And as far as we know
We were way before our time
As bold as we were blind
Just another perfect mistake
Another bridge to take
On the way to letting go

This ain't goodbye
This is just where love goes
When words aren't warm enough
To keep away the cold
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
It's not where our story ends
But I know you can't be mine
Not the way you've always been
As long as we've got time
Then this ain't goodbye
Oh no, this ain't goodbye

We were stars up in the sunlit sky
That no one else could see
Neither of us thought to ever ask why
It wasn't meant to be
Maybe we were way too high
To ever understand
Baby, we were victims of all
All the foolish plans
We began to divide

But this ain't goodbye
This is just where love goes
When words aren't warm enough
To keep away the cold
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
It's not where our story ends
But I know you can't be mine
Not the way you've always been
As long as we've got time
This ain't goodbye
Oh no, this ain't goodbye

This ain't goodbye

You and I, we're friends from outer space
Afraid to let go
The only two who understood this place
And as far as we know

This ain't goodbye
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
This ain't goodbye
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
This ain't goodbye
This is just where love goes
When words aren't warm enough
To keep away the cold
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
It's not where our story ends
But I know you can't be mine
Not the way you've always been
Oh no, don't say it

Don't say goodbye'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
