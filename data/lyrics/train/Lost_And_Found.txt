My dad said "Son, one day we'll have a drink together
You're young, you got to take your time
Just trust, let me raise you right, and later
We can raise a glass to life, and say"

Here's to the time we have
Here's to the lines we crossed
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
Here's to the time we have
Thank God for what we got
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost

And found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around

And now I'm all grown, tryna' keep up with my daughter
Wish that I could time
Baby, girl, if you listen to your father
One day, we'll raise a glass to life and say

Here's to the time we have
Here's to the lines we crossed
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
Here's to the time we have
Thank God for what we got
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost

And found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around

We can celebrate the highlight
(Oh, we love the highlight)
We can celebrate the fall
([?])
We can celebrate the good times
(Oh, all the good times)
We can celebrate it all
(Oh, it's a celebration)

Here's to the time we have
Here's to the lines we crossed
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
Here's to the time we have
Thank God for what we got
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost

And found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around''''''''''''''''''
