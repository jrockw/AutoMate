I think about my problems
And I truly understand in a world like this
Being a white man
I'm ashamed that I complained
I'm not sure that I know pain, but I know this

I'd give it all for one more night with you
I'd give it all for one more night with you

I see faces everyday, they're looking at me in ways if the same
If you'd only knew, you wouldn't last a day in my shoes
And I supposed that's true
I have a lot, maybe too much

But
I'd give it all for one more night with you
I'd give it all for one more night with you

Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Be free

I worked hard at what I do
It's the one thing that gets me through
But I'm starting to forget
But what I want is to remember, what I want is to remember
What I want, do you remember me?

(I'd give it all all all all)

I'd give it all for one more night with you
I'd give it all for one more night with you

Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, be free
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, be free
Don't worry about me
Don't worry about me''''''''''''''''''
