My funny valentine
I know what's on your mind
I know that you cry sometimes
Ooh, oh, oh

Baby, it's all in your head
Do you remember what I said?
When we sat there on your bed
Ooh, oh, oh

That I, I'm never gonna tell ya' lies
I'll always stand by your side
So when're ya' gonna realize?

I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine

Oh, baby, if you lose
I would do anything for you
Even when I'm old, and blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Gonna prove it everyday
All night in every way
Gonna show you what I say
Is true, ooh, ooh

That I, I'm never gonna tell ya' lies
I'll always stand by your side
So when're ya' gonna realize?

I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine

That I, I'm never gonna tell ya' lies
I'll always stand by your side
So when're ya' gonna realize?

I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine''''''''''''''''
