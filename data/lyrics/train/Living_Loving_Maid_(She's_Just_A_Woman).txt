With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down

Alimony, alimony payin' your bills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down

Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Uh, you got it

Nobody hears a single word you say
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
But you keep on talkin' till your dyin' day
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down

Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.''''''''''''''''''''''''
