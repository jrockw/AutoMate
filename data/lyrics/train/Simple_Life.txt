Mother Nature and the elephant man
Refill prescription to the radio land
Tatoos and interviews, another way to say
You've grabbed us by the balls and taken us away
Halleluja, another video
Surgically removed, reimproved, it's the way to go

I was raised on cigarettes and jazz
Cheap drive-in movies and soul
Now I live in basements and flats
Where did the simple life go?

Talk show, talk show,
Talk about nothing that you really wanna know, talk show
Freak show, peep show,
You're on the cover of a magazine, in between
There is a scene that you really wanna know

I was raised on alcohol and blues
Front porches and the front page of the Sunday news
Now I live in silicone crowds
Where did the simple life go?

Halleluja, another video
Surgically removed, reimproved, it's the way to go
Halleluja, you changed your hair
Now you want to change the world

I was raised on baseball and football
Didn't even know their names
Now I live in a suicide trap
Where did the simple life go?''''''''''''''''
