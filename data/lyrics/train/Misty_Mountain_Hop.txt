Walking in the park just the other day baby
What do you want do you think I say

Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in
Their hair said hey boy do you wanna score
And you know how it is

I really don't know what time it was
Whoa whoa whoa
So I asked them if I could stay awhile

I didn't notice but it had grown very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind

Just then a police man stepped up to me ask us said
Please hey would we care to get in line
Get in line well you know

They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
He said that his friends would all drop by
Oho oho oho

Why don't you take a good look at yourself


And describe what you see and baby baby do you like it

There you sit sitting and staring like a bump on a shelf rusting
I'm not trying to fool you

You really don't care if they're coming
Whoa whoa whoa
I know that it's all a state of mind

If you go down in the streets today baby you better
You better open your eyes whoa oh yeah

Folks down there really don't care really don't care don't care really don't
Which which way the pressure lies
So I decided what I'm gonna do now

So I'm packing my bags for the misty mountain where
The spirits go now over the hills where the spirits fly

Oho oho oho oho oho oho
I really don't know oh
I really don't know oh''''''''''''''''
