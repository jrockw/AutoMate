I should have quit you a long time ago
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, a long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children, down on this killing floor
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
No, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues straight down the line

Said, people worry I can't keep you satisfied
Let me tell you baby, you ain't nothin' but a two-bit, no-good jive
I went asleep last night, worked as hard as I can
Bring home my money, you take my money, give it to another man
I should have quit you, baby, such a long time ago
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles, down on this killing floor
Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, I'm gonna fall right out of bed

Hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, baby
I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor.''''''''''''''''
