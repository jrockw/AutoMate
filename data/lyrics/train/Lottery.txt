I want you to know that the love
I have for you right now is deep
And real, and right, and it will be
After tonight

Here comes the winning number
Thunder clapping in the summer skies
Till confetti comes down
Here comes a kiss, y'all
Wish y'all'd
Open up that Cristal
Baby, 'cause we're moving uptown

Every time you're here with me
It's like I won the lottery
As rich as I could wish to be
It's like I won the lottery

I want you to know that the love
I have for you right now is deep
And real, and right, and it will be
After tonight

Here comes the winning number
Thunder clapping in the summer skies
Till confetti comes down
Here comes a kiss, y'all
Wish y'all'd
Open up that Cristal
Baby, 'cause we're moving uptown

We got the golden ticket
Kick it, hammock and a picket fence
And a pool underground
Take you on a LV spend spree
Open up that Dom P
Baby, 'cause we're Beverly bound

Every time you're here with me
It's like I won the lottery
As rich as I could wish to be
It's like I won the lottery

Every time you're here with me
It's like I won the lottery
As rich as I could wish to be
It's like I won the lottery''''''''''''''''''
