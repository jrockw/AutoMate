In the mornin' don't say you love me,
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor. Oh, guitar
Won't need too much persuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin',
But with a face like that you got nothin' to laugh about.
Red hair, lips and fingernails,
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go upstairs and read my Tarot cards
Come on
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me

For tonight you'd better stay with me
Come on
So, in the mornin', don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne,
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up
Keyboard, come on

Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me
Get up, get out now
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me
Say what's your name again''''''''''''''''
