I hopelessly, helplessly, wonder why,
Everything had changed, around me, mhmm
I'd tell it to your face, but you lost your face along the way,
Can I say it on the phone, if I thought you were alone,
Why do things have to change?

And you don't need my pictures on your wall,
You say you need no one,
And you don't need my secret midnight call,
I guess you need no one,
Is anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that we'll tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that we'll tell this tale,

You're in and out, up and down,
Wonder if you're lost or found,
But I got my hands on you,
Are you strong enough to tow the line,
Are you gonna make me yours,
Or do I make you mine,

I'm in and out I'm up and down,
Wonder if I'm lost or found,
But I need your hands on me now,

But you don't need my pictures on your wall,
You say you need no one,
And you don't need my secret midnight call,
I guess you need no one,
Is anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that will tell this tale,

I hopelessly,
(Is anybody waiting at home,)
Helplessly,
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven, if its hell)
Wonder why,
Is anybody waiting at home)
Everything's gotta change...''''''''''''''''''
