Leaves are falling all around
It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you I'm much obliged
Such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way.
And now I smell the rain
And with it pain
And it's headed my way

Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I got one thing I got to do
Ramble on
Well now's the time the time is now
Sing my song
I'm goin' around the world
Gonna find my girl
I'm on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I'm gonna ramble on
I'm gonna find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
To our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

When I'm alone
Oh, well now's the time
The time is now
Sing my song
I'm going around the world
Gonna find my girl
I'm on my way

I've been this way ten years to the day
I'm gonna ramble on
I'm gonna find the queen of all my dreams

Life's the tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
But years ago
In days of old
The magic filled the air
But in the darkest steps of Mordor
I met a girl so fair

But go up to her I run
Courage up and slipped away with her
Ah shit

And there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on
Ramblin' on
I'm gonna sing my song
I'm going around the world
Gonna find my girl
I'm on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I'm gonna ramble on
Sing my song
I'm going around the world
I wanna see my girl

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
I went searching for my baby

My, my, my, my, my baby''''''''''''''''
