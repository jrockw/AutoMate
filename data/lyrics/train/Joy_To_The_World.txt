Joy to the world! The Lord is come.
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart
Prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
Heaven and nature sing
Heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, the sounding joy

Ah calling all angels
Ah calling all angels

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations proof
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love;
Wonders of His love;
And wonders, of His love.

Joy to the world
Joy, joy, joy
Joy, joy to the world
Joy to the world
Ooh joy, joy to the world
Ah joy to the world
Joy to the world''''''''''''''''''
