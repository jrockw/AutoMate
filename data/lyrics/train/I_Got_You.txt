Hey, did you hear about the one that got away, they say
He looked left, she turned right
Meant to be together but not that night
It's when fate's running late, we tend to make mistakes, we go
'Round and 'round from love to love
It's either way too much or not enough

Gimme
Lazy days with nothing better to do
Than singing "Old black water keep on rolling"
While I wait for you
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine
I'm leaving the ghosts behind until

I got you
I got you
You're the sun through my window
Warming my skin, oh you
I got you
Hey

Then, when one of them was taken,
The other one was waiting for the next big thing
To bring them to the gates of heaven
Or maybe just a late night in Vegas
It's true that's what we do when we're going down swinging
Then coming up singing the blues
Wearing out my shoes
Chasing new faces to get to you

Driving home on a summer night
Singing "Old black water keep on rolling"
Till the time is right
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine
Sit back, enjoy the ride until

I got you
I got you
You're the sun through my window
Warming my skin, oh you
I got you
Like Sonny and Cher
Except I'll be there for you
I got you
Let Old black water bring us together

Old black water keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me
Old black water keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
Pretty mama

Here she comes
I got you
I got you
You're the sun through my window
Warming my skin, oh you
I got you
Like Sonny and Cher
You know I'll be there for you
I got you
Let Old black water bring us together
You
I got you
I got you
I got you, baby

By the hand hand, take me by the hand, pretty mama
Dance with your daddy all night long
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand
By the hand hand, take me by the hand, pretty mama
Dance with your daddy all night long
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand''''''''''''''''''
