Underneath these lifelong
Things that were right till they went wrong
When misunderstood stood in my way

Now down in the heart of a matter of fact
There's a place I remember and I wanna go back
Where I stop getting even and started to change

All I want is you to see me

Here I am, you still know me
Here I am, take another look
Here I am, same old story in a brand new book

If second chances were dances you know I would have two left feet
But at least I'd have a front row seat to love
And so I've been turning it upside down

Shaking it up and shaking it out
And now I'm running for you
Instead of running from me

All I want is you to see me

Here I am, new as morning
Here I am just like the sun
Here I am without warning, I'm the one for you

Here I am, you still know me
Here I am, take another look
Here I am, same old story in a brand new book

And now I get set of second chances to turn
The pages of the lessons of the love that I've learned
Was true, now all I'm missing is you

All I want is you to see me

Here I am, new as morning
Here I am just like the sun
Here I am without warning
I'm the one for you

Here I am, you still know me
Here I am, take another look
Here I am, same old story in a brand new book

Here I am
Here I am, the same old story in a brand new book''''''''''''''''''
