It's love
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, my my

Well I drop myself on the cold cement
Hang my head 'cause my woman's bent
No lights on but I know that she's home
So I ring the bell another forty time
The neighbor dog made me lose my mind
Now I see her car slide down the road

It's love
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, my my

I know how to get back to me
I know how to get back to me

Now I act as if I just got there
From doing important shit somewhere
But she don't seem impressed with me at all
So I decided as I stood
I'm done with this one now for good


But I know as soon as I get home
And see that I'm all by myself
I'm gonna pick up the phone
And tell her I would do anything to have her back again
'Cause that's love

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, my my

I know how to get back to me
I know how to get back to me
I know how to get back to me
(Got to get back to me)
I know how to get back to me
(Got to get back to me)

I know how to get back to me
(Got to get back to me)
I know how to get back to me
(Got to get back to me)
I know how to get back''''''''''''''''''''''''
