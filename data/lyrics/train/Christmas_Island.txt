If someone told me it was Christmas day
I would say no way, what kind a game you playing?
My feets in the sand, the sun's got a plan to make me tan
Oh all I know is the snow can take a holiday
When you get here Margarita wine
Just don't forget the line
And if you're feeling so, this mistletoe
Ain't got nowhere to go
No no, high Sierra goodbye
Christmas island hello

(Hey high Sierra goodbye, Christmas island hello)

The way I see it gimme Mexico or Hawaii though, Costa Rica yo
December summer fun, when you're lying in the pouring sun
I just wanna go where the snow, don't know no oneVerse 4
If you're coming, I'll pick up the bill
Just don't bring no chill, that's unless you will
A christmas summer chill, with an island flow
High Sierra goodbye, Christmas island hello

(Hey high Sierra goodbye, Christmas island hello)

Give me Christmas on an island, on an island, see me smiling
Take me from the mountain, from the mountain
From the mountain, hear me shouting
Come on see me smiling
Take me back to Christmas island

(Hey high Sierra goodbye, Christmas island hello)''''''''''''''''
