Now don't look down,
'Cause you might just see what's in the middle.
The rumour has it you've been looking for me
but there ain't much left of me to see - here.
Now don't go down - no, no.
Put your face in the place of a beetle.
Your lip is about to shine
for a fee you'll be happy to be - mine.

Look at yourself, child!
You're the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back
'till you wait on a track for a train in the rain
and it's coming fast.
Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh, hooh-hooh, hooh, train.
(Yeah)

You go so fast.
It's a race for the place in the running.
And it won't take long 'till it brings you down - no
I'm just a wasting time, just a waste o' time, just a wasting time in the big town.

Look at yourself, child!

Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh, hooh-hooh, hooh-hooh, 
hooh-hooh, hooh, train.

Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

Well, it's about a quarter to four
and I'm not really here no more
Sixteen and I've been low down
and now I've got a mess
And the back of your leg starts to drag down my,
Starts to drag down my scream.
Here it goes again.
Aha, oh, yeah yeah.

Look at yourself, girl. 
Look at myself, boy.
Look at yourself, girl. Look at yourself, girl.
Look at yourself, world. Look at your...

Look at yourself, child!
You're the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back
'till you wait on a track for a train in the rain
and it's coming fast.

Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh, hooh-hooh, hooh-hooh, 
hooh-hooh, hooh, train.

Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh, hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh, 
hooh-hooh, hooh, train.

You're the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back
'till you wait on a track for a train in the rain
and it's coming fast.''''''''''''''''''
