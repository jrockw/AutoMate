Venus Demilo, Demilo, Demilo
Sweet Mona Lisa do you say, you say
Tower, you're leaning, you're falling, you're leaning
I am a picture of perfect confusion, a canyon abandoned,

Demilo, hey, what you gonna be
Sooner or later we all fall, all fall
I don't wanna be unhappy, I don't wanna fall

Went back to Erie with my tail between my
Legs today
Caught inside pages, you're crazy, I'm crazy, Demilo


Demilo, hey, what you gonna be
Sooner or later we all fall, all fall
I don't wanna be unhappy, I don't wanna fall

Tower, you're leaning, you're falling, you're leaning
I am a picture of perfect confusion, a canyon abandoned,

Demilo, hey, what you gonna be
Sooner or later we all fall, all fall
I don't wanna be unhappy, I don't wanna fall
Hey, what you gonna be''''''''''''''''
