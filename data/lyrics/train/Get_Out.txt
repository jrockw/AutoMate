I know you turn your back on Mother Nature
For everything she puts you through
She wakes up every day and tries to greet you
I'm hopin' that you make it through

I called every morning - tried to reach you
And waited for you Saturday
But sunshine did not not come running
I'm a change your heart away

Get out Get out
Let the morning break in you
(Get out Get out)
I won't run unless I'm running after you

Thought that he'd be a high class mover
Well he's high now mover
But his class ain't new

You were born to be ballerina
So you danced your way to Hollywood
Dancing's what you got, but not like you wanted
Not like you wanted anything

Get out Get out


Let the morning break in you
(Get out Get out)
I won't run unless I'm running after you

All the bigs got nothing at the top
- So stop and get a good look - at this miracle
All the big lie, nothing up above, just know
- So get a good look - at this miracle
'Cause this miracle is you
This miracle is you

Get out Get out
Let the morning break in you
(Get out Get out)
I won't run unless I'm running after you

Get out Get out
Let the morning break in you
(Get out Get out)
I won't run unless I'm running after you

And I won't run unless I'm running after you
And I won't run unless I'm running after you''''''''''''''''''''
