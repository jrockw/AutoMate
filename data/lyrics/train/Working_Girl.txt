She said
I'm not somebody who likes the game
So don't expect me to chase you babe
If you ain't sweet like Aspartame
Let me get the door for ya

If you want a back and forth thang
Go and get yourself a boomerang
If you don't like the bacon I bring
Let me get the door for ya

She said
I can love you like you never been
And keep you going just like Ritalin
But if you ain't a working man
Let me get the door for ya

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if you don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if you don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door

I said
I ain't like them other men
Who think they matter 'cause they own a Benz
They left you sick, I'm your medicine
Let me get the door for ya

And baby let me ease your mind
I know you been working over time
And if you wanna leave behind the 9 to 5
And see inside a real man
Let me get the door for ya

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if you don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if you don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door

There's the door baby
If you don't like it
There's the door baby
If you don't like it
There's the door baby
If you don't like it
If you don't like
Bet you're gonna love it

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
I'm in love...

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if you don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya
