Sometimes you want your money back, then some
Sometimes you wonder if these things have ever been done
Sometimes you get a little bit too high, see?
But love ain't free

I'll sing it louder, so the back can hear
It ain't about money, so have no fear
"But it takes a little change, and change is good"
That's what mama said, 'cause she understood

A man is just a man, but a woman's a queen
Now I finally understand what she needs
It's real simple, if your woman is good
The sky is the limit, but what you could be

Two quarters, a diamond, silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a diamond, silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind

Sometimes girls just wanna have fun
Sometimes the honey might get you stung
Sometimes you get a little bit too loaded, no
Well, love can go

I'll sing it louder, so the back can dance
It ain't about money, so there's a chance
But it takes a little change, and change is good
That's what mama said, 'cause she understood

Two quarters, a diamond, silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a diamond, silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind

Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good

Two quarters, a diamond, silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a diamond, silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind

Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good''''''''''''''''''
