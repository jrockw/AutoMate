I wanna take you with me
To life with no more yesterdays
We can start again awake and so excited
And change the way we always push, we always pull

I'll open up and be your parachute
And I'll never let you down
So open up and be my human angel
And we'll only hit the ground
Running

And when the world gets sharp
And tries to cut you down to size
And makes you feel like giving in, oh
I will stay, I will rain, I will wash the words
And pain away and I will
Chase away the way we push, the way we pull, you're beautiful

I'll open up and be your parachute
And I'll never let you down
So open up and be my human angel
And we'll only hit the ground
Running, running

And if it feels like we might drop
It will stop so, don't look down
It wouldn't be the same without you
This life is too good to give up on

I'll open up and be your parachute
And I'll never let you down
So open up and be my human angel
And we'll only hit the ground
And we're gonna hit the ground
Running, running''''''''''''''''''
