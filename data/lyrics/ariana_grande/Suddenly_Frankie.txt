Frankie:
Lift up your head
Wash off your mascara
Here take my Kleenex
Wipe that lipstick away
Just kidding
Show me your face clean as the morning
I know things were bad
But now they're okay

Suddenly Frankie is standing beside you
You don't need no make-up
Don't have to pretend
Suddenly Frankie is here to provide you
Sweet understanding
Frankie's your friend

Ariana:
Nobody ever treated me kindly
Daddy left early
Mama was poor
I'd meet a man
And I'd follow him blindly
He'd snap his fingers
Me, I'd say, "Sure"

Suddenly Frankie is standing beside me
He don't give me orders
He don't condescend
Suddenly Frankie is here to provide me
Sweet understanding
Frankie's my friend

Frankie:
Tell me this feeling
Will last 'til forever
Tell me the bad times are clean washed away
Ariana:
Please understand that it's still strange and frightening
For losers like I've been it's so hard to say

Ariana (Frankie):
Suddenly Frankie
(Suddenly Frankie)
He purified me
(He purified you)

Suddenly Frankie
(Suddenly Frankie)
Showed me I can
(Yes, you can)

Both:
Learn how to be more
Ariana // Frankie:
The girl that's inside me // The girl that's inside you
Frankie (Ariana):
With sweet understanding
(With sweet understanding)
With sweet understanding
(With sweet understanding)
With sweet understanding
Both:
Frankie's your man''''''''''''''''
