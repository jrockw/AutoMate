Drivin' down Sunset on a Saturday night
It's gettin' kinda crazy under the lights
But we don't care we're passing our time
Watchin' those L.A. Boyz roll by

In their droptops, Harleys, Escalades too
A hundred different flavors to vary your view
There's one for me, and there's one for you
Watchin' them L.A. Boyz roll through

Lookin' so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got, got the goods
So let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz
Ridin' the waves up in Malibu
They really get, get to you
So let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz

Give it up, give it up
You don't have no choice
Give it up, give it up
For the L.A. Boyz

West side, East side, everywhere between
Rockstars jammin' the promenade for free
Flippin' their skateboards on Venice beach
L.A. Boyz come play with me
Turn it up
Turn it up
And come play with me

Lookin' so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got, got the goods
So let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz
Ridin' the waves up in Malibu
They really get, get to you
So let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz

Put your number in my phone, oh, maybe I'll call you, maybe not
What you doin' all alone?
Come show me what you got, boy
Show me what you got, got boy
What you got boy show me what you got

Lookin' so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got, got the goods
So let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz
Ridin' the waves up in Malibu
They really get, get to you
So let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz
Give it up for the L.A. Boyz!
Give it up for the L.A. Boyz!
Give it up for the L.A. Boyz!
Give it up for the L.A. Boyz!
Give it up for the L.A. Boyz!
Give it up for the L.A. Boyz!
Let's give it up for those L.A. Boyz''''''''''''''
