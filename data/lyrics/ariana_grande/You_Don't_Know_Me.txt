(Whoa, whoa)
(H-h-here we go)

Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't even need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told

I see you thinking
But there's just one thing de-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand, no

Thinking you're the reason that it ends
But you won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs
Is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me 'cause that's not reality
And so I can't be a silhouette of who I'm becoming
You don't know me but there's more to see, my love

You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(You don't know me)
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
And you don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
But there's just one thing d-e-e-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love
(My love)'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
