You walked in, caught my attention;
I've never seen a man with so much dimension...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...

Now I can't wait to hold you in my arms;
I know I was made for you - I'm in love with all your charm...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...

Well, I want you - got to have it,
And I need you like I never have loved before...
Oh, I want you - ooh, I need you;
Got to have you like I never had lovin' before...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
