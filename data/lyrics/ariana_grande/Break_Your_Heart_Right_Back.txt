Ariana Grande:
I should've saw it coming, I should've saw the signs,
But I wanted to believe you, trust you - you said you wouldn't lie...
But baby, you were so good, so good, you had me going blind;
You said he was your best friend, I'm guessing I wasn't your type... hey...

What goes around comes around, and if it goes up, it comes down;
I know you mad 'cause I found out - want you to feel what I feel right now...

Now that it's over, I just wanna break your heart right back, right back;
Want you to cry me a river, I just wanna break your heart right back, yeah...
Hey, all this time I was blind, runnin' 'round, tellin' everybody,
"My baby loves me, my baby loves me,
My baby, my baby, my baby loves me..."

You said I was your best, would be your last;
Now he's gone, you're alone - don't want you back...
You're telling me you're sorry, well, sorry, my friend,
'Cause I've already been there, done that, ain't doing this again... no...

What goes around comes around, and if it goes up, it comes down;
I know you mad 'cause I found out - want you to feel what I feel right now...

Now that it's over, I just wanna break your heart right back, right back;
Want you to cry me a river, I just wanna break your heart right back, yeah...
Hey, all this time I was blind, runnin' 'round, tellin' everybody,
"My baby loves me, my baby loves me, (My baby loves me...)
My baby, my baby, my baby loves me..."
"My baby loves me, my baby loves me,
My baby, my baby, my baby loves me..."

Childish Gambino:
Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal;
Don't understand how to spell it out for you...
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why;
Sorry, had to tell ya I'm a nice guy,
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much;
I step on stage and girls move too much...
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch,
And he with them other guys, you know it's true, 'cause...
G-A-M-B-I-N-O, I
Know they hate, but I don't know why, uh...
I know the way he did you as whack,
But I know how you can get dude right back...
And get with me...

Both:
Now that it's over, I just wanna break your heart right back, right back;
Want you to cry me a river, I just wanna break your heart right back, yeah...
Hey, all this time I was blind, running 'round, telling everybody,
"My baby loves me (Do he really, though?), my baby loves me (Do he really, though?),
My baby, my baby, my baby loves me...
"My baby loves me (Do he really, though?), my baby loves me (Do he really, though?),
My baby, my baby, my baby loves me..."

Ariana:
Ooh... yeah... runnin' around town, tellin' everybody...
Ooh... yeah... runnin' around town, tellin' everybody...
Ooh... yeah... runnin' around town, tellin' everybody...
Ooh... yeah... runnin' around town, tellin' everybody...
