Ariana:
Keep your hands on me
Don't take them off 
Until I say so 
Let me break you off
We'll be taking off
Or maybe making love
You just keep your eyes on my you know what

Trembling, when you touch
Rush is racing, body baking
Picture me and you making
Making sweet love
Baby give it to me

Eyes on me, dance on me tonight
Your all, all on me
Keep your hands on me

Don't take them off
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Don't take them off
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby put your hands on me

A$AP Ferg:

Every day with me
And my maker hard rock A-S-A-P

Can I, can I, can I please put my hand on it?
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it
Bubble big got a parachute to land on it
Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?

It's your birthday
Every day with me
And my maker hard rock A-S-A-P
Got me talking marriage
I like what I see
And might put a ring on it
Word to B and Jay-Z
But before I do that let me put a hand on it
Oh so hot I could catch a tan on it
Got me sweating so much we can swim on the dancefloor
We gonn have to mes around and put a dam on it
Dam on it

Don't take them off
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
Don't take them off
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby put your hands on me''''''''''''''''''
