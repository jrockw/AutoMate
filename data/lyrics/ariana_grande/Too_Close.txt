(I want to...) Ah, ah, ah...
(I want to...) Ah, ah, ah...

You know what I want, I know what you don't,
I should be the one you love
Boy, you got my mind, playing truth or dare,
Daring me to kiss you right here

But we've been friends so long and it seems so wrong,
And everyone can see you're perfect for me,
But I just can't let it show... oh...

I've been thinkin' about you;
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know...
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we get too close...
Ah, ah, ah - boy, if we get too close... (I want you)
Ah, ah, ah - (I-I-I'm) down if we get too close...

Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great...
So what would you do, what would you say
If I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long and it seems so wrong,
And everyone can see you're perfect for me,
But I just can't let it show...
