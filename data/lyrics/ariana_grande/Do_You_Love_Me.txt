Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance?
Watch me now
Drop

I can Mash Potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana and your boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you something baby
I think I love you

Born to party, born to rock
Big fat baby, are we on top, huh
Rolling in the cab
Hilowitz making hits like granddaddy
Bust a move, get in the groove
Baby girl, I'm into you
Show me what you can do
I thought you knew
You could as long as you with Blu

Tell me if it's meant to be
I'd give my love but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talkin' cheap
Baby cash, spend time with me
Say dance, dance, young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
I'm right here, you can hold my hand
Give you what I need to know

Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance?
Watch me now
Drop

'Cause I can mash potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana and my boy SkyBlu
Gotta tell you something baby
I think I love you

Got the money, got the passion
On the dance floor I'm Michael Jackson
Time for some action, here we go
Sky Blu on the stereo
Turn it up, hurry up
She doing it Grande that's for sure
Her plus me you can add enough
You'll never get enough

Tell me if it's meant to be
I'd give my love but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talkin' cheap
Baby cash, spend time with me
Say dance, dance, young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
I'm right here, you can hold my hand
Give you what I need to know

Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Ooh do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Oh, do you love me boy? Ooh
Now that I can dance?
Watch me now

You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
But now I'm back to let you know
I can really shuffle 'em down, yeah

(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Love me?)
(Do you love me?)''''''''''''''''''
