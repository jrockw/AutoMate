Graham:
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

Ariana:
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle I stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from the Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

Fall on my knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

Both:
Fall on your knees // Fall on my knees
Both:
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine''''''''''''''''
