Every day I'm grindin'
I don't even get a weekend
Been livin' my life
In black and white, no sleeping
So tonight I'm gonna flip it
Like in a New York minute
We're gonna hail a cab
And don't look back
Once we get in it

Lemme hear you say
Ooh
Can you keep it bottled up?
X 2

Make it pop like pink champagne
In the purple rain
Gonna paint paint paint the city
Gonna show of all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne
Let 'em know our names.
Scream it so loud
They'll hear us in LA
We're poppin' like pink champagne x 3

Don't need no guest list
Everybody's invited
I said even if you can't get in
We'll dance outside it
We're gonna make this bubble
Carbonate some trouble
When your life gets back
Gotta take it back to another level

Lemme hear you say
Ooh
Can you keep it bottled up?
X 2

Make it pop like pink champagne
In the purple rain
Gonna paint paint paint the city
Gonna show off all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne
Let 'em know our names.
Scream it so loud
They'll hear us in LA
We're poppin' like pink champagne x 3

Make it pop
Ooh

Lemme hear you say
Ooh
Can you keep it bottled up?
X 2

Make it pop like pink champagne
In the purple rain
Gonna paint paint paint the city
Gonna show off all our pretty, pretty
Pink champagne
Let 'em know our names.
Scream it so loud.
They'll hear us in LA
We're poppin' like pink champagne x 3

We're popping like pink champagne!''''''''''''''''
