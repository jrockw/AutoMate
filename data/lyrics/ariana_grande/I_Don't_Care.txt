Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before;
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more...
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be,
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point? No...

I don't care about it anymore, no,
I don't care about it anymore...
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me,
Used to have a hold on me, (Used to have a hold on me...)
Like what do you think? And what he thinks, and what they think,
But I love me, yeah...

I don't care about it anymore, no,
I don't care about it anymore...

I-I-I-I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah...
I-I-I-yea, yeah, ah, oh, I...
I-I-I-I ooh, ooh, ooh... oh...
I don't care about it anymore...
I don't care about it anymore...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
