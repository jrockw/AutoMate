Someday I'll let you in
Treat you right
Drive you outta your mind
Ooh

You never met a chick like me
Burn so bright
I'm gonna make you blind

Always want what you can't have
Is it so bad if you don't get what you wanted
Make you feel good
As I whip you
Into shape, ya boy
Let's get it started!

Give it up
You can't win
'Cause I know where you've been
Such a shame
You don't put up a fight
That's a game that we play
At the end of the night
It's the same old story
But you never get it right
Give it up

Come a little closer
Baby, baby
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby, baby

So stop trying to walk away
No you won't ever leave me behind

(No)

You better believe that I'm here to stay
(That's right)

'Cause you're the shade and I'm the sunshine
(Ooh)

Look at me boy
'Cause I got you
Where I want you
Isn't it so exciting?
Wanna shake you
Wanna break you
Take a backseat boy
'Cause now I'm driving

Give it up
You can't win
'Cause I know where you've been
Such a shame
You don't put up a fight
That's a game that we play
At the end of the night
It's the same old story
But you never get it right
Give it up

A ooh yeah
Ah oooho heeey
Hey yeah yeah yeah

Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby, baby
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby, baby
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby
If you are my baby
Then I'll make you crazy tonight

Look at me boy
'Cause I got you
Where I want you
Isn't it so exciting?
Wanna shake you
When I break you
Take a backseat boy
'Cause now I'm driving

Give it up
You can't win
'Cause I know where you've been
Such a shame
You don't put up a fight
That's a game that we play
At the end of the night
It's the same old story
But you never get it right
Give it up
Oh
Yeah!''''''''''''''''''
