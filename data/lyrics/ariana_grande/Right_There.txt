(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
Then put your hands up... (Then put your hands up...)
(If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
Then put your hands up... (Then put your hands up...)

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

Sean Don!
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title;
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walk out looking like a model...
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo,
On the moon - who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you... (got you...)
I got you...

Boy, you make me feel so lucky;
Finally the stars align...
Never has it been so easy
To be in love, and to give you this heart of mine...

You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be all right...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh...

And I'll never let you go...

You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

I get butterflies just thinking
About you - boy, you're on my mind...
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming,
Lost in your eyes, and I lose all track of time...

You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be all right...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you, oh...

And I'll never let you go...

You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

(What, okay, what...)
Now if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to public transportation?
Would you still be at home for me, with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too - you know I had some girls missionary;
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary,
And bible, I got it recycled - I love and I like you.
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-through,
That's why I got you...

And I'll never let you go... (I got you.)

You should know I'm never gonna change; (I'm never gonna change...)
I'm always gonna stay... (I'm always gonna stay...)
When you call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there...), right there...
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it! I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
Got it, babe...''''''''''''''''''
