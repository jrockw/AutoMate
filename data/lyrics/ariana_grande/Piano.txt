I could write a song with my new piano;
I could sing about how love is a losing battle...
Not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
It's not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)

And I could sing about Cupid and a shooting arrow;
In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's so hard... (It's so hard...)
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance - don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand...

So hold up and take it through the night,
And you should follow through to make it alright...
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano...

I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling, boy,
And how I'm doing things my way;
If I got my piano, then I know I'll be okay, baby!

So hold up and take it through the night,
And you should follow through to make it alright...
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
