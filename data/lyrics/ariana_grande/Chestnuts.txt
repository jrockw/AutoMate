Ariana:
Chestnuts roasting at an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

Liz:
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Ariana:
Everybody knows a turkey
And some misletoe help to make the season bright

Liz:
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Ariana:
They know that Santa's on his way

Liz:
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

Ariana:
And every mother's child is going to spy

Liz:
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

Both:
And so I'm offering this simple phrase

Ariana:
To kids from one to ninety-two

Both:
Although it's been said many times, many ways,
Merry Christmas to you!
