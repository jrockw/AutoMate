Now you finally tell me how you feel;
Guess your words just came a little too late...
All the drama, boy, it's overkill;
Don't be mad at me 'cause you've been replaced - know your place!

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it'd be different - if you spoke, I would've listened, but now I'm with somebody else...
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would've shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you'll never know, you'll never know...

Now it's probably hard for you to hear,
But there's nothing left for you to say...
Had my heart all in your hands - boy, what you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around...

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it'd be different - if you spoke, I would've listened, but now I'm with somebody else...

And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;

Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you'll never know, you'll never know...

(You'll never know...) Boy, you should've told me, told me...
(You'll never know...) Boy, you should've let me know...
(You'll never know...) Boy, you could've been there for me,
But now, you'll never know, you'll never know...

It's not my fault you're a little bit too late;
You're the only one to blame - Wipe that look off your face...
You can wish a thousand times, but none of that will change my mind, boy;
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would've shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you'll never know... oh, baby!

(You'll never know...) Boy, you could've told me, told me...
(You'll never know...) Boy, you could've let me know...
(You'll never know...) Boy, you could've been there for me...
But now, you'll never know, you'll never know...

(You'll never know...) You will never know, you will never know, oh, baby...
(You'll never know...) No...
(You'll never know...)
You will never know! Ooh...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
