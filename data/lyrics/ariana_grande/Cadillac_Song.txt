Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...

Summer days with my honey, worried 'bout not a thing,
Back in the day when things were easier than the breeze...
Who knew that kiss was the last one? I never thought we would change;
Baby, I'm missing you...

Oh, we shoulda been forever, but we fell apart;
Might have separated, but you took my heart...
Always knew I wasn't really over us,
And sometimes, I catch myself...

I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...
You! Yeah... 
Oh...

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing cause time was all we spent...

Oh, we shoulda been forever, but we fell apart;
Might have separated, but you took my heart...
Always knew I wasn't really over us,
And sometimes, I catch myself...

You! Yeah...
Oh, babe... mm...
Oh, baby... oh, babe...''''''''''''''''
