If you know how to be my lover, maybe you can be my baby;
Hold me close under the cover, kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy...
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby;
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy...

If you know how to treat me, you know how to touch me,
Maybe then you'll get your chance, a chance to love me...
It's obvious I wanna be into you,
But it all depends on all the things you do,
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise,
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest,
You can get anything you want, that you want, babe;
Just show me everything I need to see, I'll give you everything, boy!

If you know how to be my lover, maybe you can be my baby;
Hold me close under the cover, kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy...
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby;
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy...

I'll give you all of my trust if you don't mess this up;
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club...
All you got is eyes for me;
I'm the only girl you see...
So if you treat me right, just the way that I want to,
Oh baby boy, I promise that I'll be on you,
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-on you;
Night to the mo-oh-oh-oh-oh-orning!

If you know how to be my lover, maybe you can be my baby;
Hold me close under the covers, kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy...
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby;
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy...

Hey...

I'll give you all of my trust if you don't mess this up;
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club...
All you got is eyes for me;
I'm the only girl you see...

If you know how to be my lover (Be my!), maybe you can be my baby;
Hold me close under the cover, kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy...
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby;
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy...''''''''''''''''''
