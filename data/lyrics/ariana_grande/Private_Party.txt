I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I tried to call my mother, but
She didn't get where I was going
I called my boyfriend and he said
Call me back a little later baby
I hung up the phone, I felt so alone
Started to feel a little pity
That's when I realized that I
Gotta find the joy inside of me

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I wanna take off all my clothes
Look at myself in the mirror
We're gonna have a conversation
We're gonna heal the disconnection
I don't remember when it started
But this is where it's gonna end
My body is beautiful and sacred
And I'm gonna celebrate it

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

All my life 
I've been looking for 
Somebody else 
To make me whole
But I had to learn the hard way 
True love began with me
This is not ego or vanity
I'm just celebrating me

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah''''''''''''''''''
