I looked in my rearview mirror, (ah) and it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah...
I'm ready to make that turn, before we both crash and burn,
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us...

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies? Guess they didn't count at that stop sign,
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light...
Hey, right when I think that we found it, well, that's when we start turnin' around;
You're saying "Baby, don't worry," but we're still going the wrong way...

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love;
Well, they must've been talking about us,
And sometimes, I feel like we've been here before...
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right...
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight;
Honey, I know we can find our way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, my baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in...
Traffic - I'm under...
Pressure... pressure...
Let's just go back to the way it was...

When we were on (Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue,
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue...)
(Avenue...) Let's just go back...''''''''''''''''''
