I've been living with devils and angels, angels, angels,
Realised you were not in the same boat, same boat, yeah.
Kills me how you love me, then you cut me down, I'll do the same,
We been living like angels and devils, devils.

I'm loving the pain, I never wanna live without it,
So why do I try?
You drive me insane, now we're screaming just to see who's louder,
So why do I try?

You got me like,
Ooh, yeah...

You and I redefine being lovesick, lovesick, lovesick,
Through it all you can still make my heart skip, heart skip, yeah.
Even when you're yelling at me, I still think you're beautiful,
Through it all you can still make my heart skip, heart skip.

I'm loving the pain, I never wanna live without it,
So why do I try?
You drive me insane, now we're screaming just to see who's louder,
So why do I try?

You got me like,
Ooh, baby, look at us,
We've been living like angels, living like devils.
Ooh, baby, look at us,
We've been loving like angels, loving like devils.

Ooh, baby, look at us,
We've been living like angels, living like devils.
Ooh, baby, look at us,
We've been loving like angels, loving like devils.

Ooh, baby, look...

I'm in love with the pain, I never wanna live without it,
So why do I try? (Do I try?)
You drive me insane, now we're screaming just to see who's louder,
So why do I try?

You got me like,
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah)
