I told you once, get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be all right
But some things are better left unsaid

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands-)
(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands-)
(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)

You tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid''''''''''''''''''
