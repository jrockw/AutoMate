Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me, I don't know where to start;
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I love you more than anything, but the words can't even touch what's in my heart...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) No, no... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

When I try to explain it, I'd be sounding insane;
The words don't ever some out right...
I get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)
And I say, "Baby, baby..." (Whoa, whoa...) "Baby..."

(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)
Baby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...)

Baby, I'm so down for you, no matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around;
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Oh, baby...
See, baby, I've been feeling you before I even knew what feelings were about...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Oh, baby... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

When I try to explain it, I'd be sounding all crazy;
Words don't ever come out right...
I get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)
And I say, "Baby, baby..." (Whoa, whoa...) "Baby..."

(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, (baby,)
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)
Baby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...)

Straight up, you got me all in, how could I not be? I sure hope you know... (I sure hope you know...)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word "love" can say it - it's better not explaining,
That's why I keep saying "Baby, I..."

(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)
Baby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...) Baby... (Baby, baby...)

(Baby I!) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it,)
(Every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it,)
Every time I try to say it, words can only complicate it...
Baby, baby... (Whoa, whoa...) Baby, baby...''''''''''''''''''
