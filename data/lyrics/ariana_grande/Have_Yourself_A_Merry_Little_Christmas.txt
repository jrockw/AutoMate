Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away, oh ooh
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore, ah
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more, ooh
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Ooh...
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more, oh
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow, oh yeah
But till then we'll have to muddle through, somehow
Oh yeah, oh ooh oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now''''''''''''''''
