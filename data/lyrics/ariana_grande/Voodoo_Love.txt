I'm gonna mix a potion up,
Make a special drink for you,
Mmmm hmmm...
Just a little sip and you're never gonna know what hit you,
Yeah,
When I'm through,
Aww yeah.

Now I'm not talkin' bout movies,
Don't need no happy end,
I just wanna make you love me,
And stay through thick and thin,
I'm just gonna use some magic,
Might feel a little drunk,
And if you try to leave me,
I'll lock you in the trunk.

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you,
My voodoo's so addicting.
Three silver spoons of brandy wine,
Just a frog and a little thyme and,
Baby you'll be mine,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah.

Boy I really knew you were the one,
The moment that I saw your eyes,
Mm hmmm,
Strong and wise and sweet and quiet,
Yeah you're just my type,
Mmm hmmm...

Now I'm not talkin' bout movies,
Don't need no happy end,
I just wanna make you love me,
And be my shiny prince,
I'm just gonna use some magic,
Might feel a little high,
But we'll be so enchanted,
And you'll feel so alive.

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you,
My voodoo's so addicting,
Three silver spoons of brandy wine,
Just a frog and a little thyme and,
Baby you'll be mine,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah.

I always get,
Just what I want,
And boy, I really want you now,
So just say yes,
Can't second guess the power of my voodoo love.

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you,
My voodoo's so addicting,
Three silver spoons of brandy wine,
Just a frog and a little thyme and,
Baby you'll be mine,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah.

I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you,
My voodoo's so addicting,
Three silver spoons of brandy wine,
Just a frog and a little thyme and,
Baby you'll be mine,
With my voodoo love,
Aw yeah,
With my voodoo love.''''''''''''''''
