Part I: Knew Better
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
That you committing' these days

'Cause I... see right through you, boy
And I, I... I ain't feeling you no more
Ain't feelin' you no more

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

Part II: Forever Boy
Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy

Been friends for a minute
That's why you know just what I like
You know my mind
You done seen boys come and go
So you know what makes me cry
So you just wanna treat me right

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
Oh, mine, time
Oh, mine, time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy''''''''''''''''''
