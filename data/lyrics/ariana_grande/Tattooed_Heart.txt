(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
You don't need a lot of money, and you don't have to play no games;
All I need is all your lovin' to get the blood rushing through my veins...

I wanna say we're going steady like it's 1954;
Now, it doesn't have to be forever,
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Ooh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Whoa-oh-oh, yeah...

You don't need to worry about makin' me crazy, 'cause I'm way past that;
So just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me, and I'll show you
How much I wanna be on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby, and lay me in your bed,
And kiss me underneath the moonlight;
Darlin', let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh, babe...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...''''''''''''''''''
