Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love
Baby we can change the world

You think you're so small
Like you're itty bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like

You think you'll never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of mind, like
It's just a waste of time
Like, like, like

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love
Baby we can change the world

I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you with me
All you boys and all you girls

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah

If we give a little love
Baby we can change the world

Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Gandhi
Resurrect King, but

If we put our heads together
We can do anything, like
You don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show much care, like
Give a wink, give a kiss
Like, give a little happiness
Like, like, like

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love
Baby we can change the world

I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you with me
All you boys and all you girls (Sing it all you boys and all you girls)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah (Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah (Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)

If we give a little love
Baby we can change the world

Don't let 'em bring you down now, down now
Don't let 'em bring you down now, down now
Ain't gonna feel my love now, love now
Ain't gonna feel my love now, love now

Don't let 'em bring you down now, down now
Don't let 'em bring you down now, down now
Ain't gonna feel my love now, love now
Ain't gonna feel my love now, love now

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If we give a little love
Baby we can change the world (we can change the world, we can change the world)

I said

All you boys and all you girls (Sing it all you boys and girls)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah (Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah (Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)

If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world (We can change the world, no)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah (Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah (Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
