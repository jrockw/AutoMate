Mmmm, watch me
Hey, woo
One, two, three... watch me

I walked over got this sunlight
Ain't got time to listen to any shade, yeah
The wind on my pony, top-down, all right
Ain't got time to let them darken my flame, that's right

So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's hurt
Dance, it's us against the world

Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
Yeah it's true, I could have all this but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about...
Mmmm, listen, watch me

You act so lonely, catch that feeling
So hold onto it for as long as you can
We could run away, to only where we know
Boy I got plans, hey

So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's hurt
Dance, it's us against the world

Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
Yeah it's true, I could have all this but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about...

Hey
They don't know about, they don't know about, about, about us
Light the fireworks, let it catch fire
We gon' dance, dance till it hurts
When we in the clubs
We 'bout to let 'em know, know who's your girl
So put your hand in my hand
It's you and me, it's us against the world
Sing it to me one more time
It's you and me, it's us against the world
Sing it to me one more time
It's you and me, it's us against the world
I'm tryna tell you honey, it's us against the world

Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
Yeah it's true, I could have all this but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about...
Mmmm, listen, watch me

(I walked over in the sunlight)
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
(Wind in my pony, top-down, all right)
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
Yeah it's true, I could have all this but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
