Where are we? What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling
Spin me round again and rub my eyes
This can't be happening

When busy streets a mess with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
Hide and seek
All those years they were here first
Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did

Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Because it is

Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's just what we need?
And you decided this

What'd you say?
Mmm, what did she say?

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
