I'll love you 'til I die, boy, every day of my life;
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you, not just on Christmas...
Wanna show you in so many ways, three-hundred-sixty-five days;
I'll give you all my presents, boy, I'm for you, not just on Christmas...

Baby, whether rain or shine, naughty or nice, I'm by your side...

I'll love you 'til I die, boy, every day of my life;
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you, not just on Christmas...

Baby, whether rain or shine, naughty or nice, I'm by your side...''''&''''&''''&''''&''&
