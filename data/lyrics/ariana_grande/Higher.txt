Been runnin' round in circles
Tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy
While chillin' with my friends

He's eyein' me
Sizin' me
Makes my body weak
He's bringin' out the freak in me

It's only been a minute
Since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you
I feel this
Spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doin'
Livin' let it go (go, go)
Ridin' havn' good times and
No one has to know

He's eyein' me
Sizin' me
Makes my body weak
He's bringin' out the freak in me

It's only been a minute
Since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you
I feel this
Spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

We got that jam
Make them dance
Make them lose their minds
(Ooh ummmm hmhm)

We got that jam
Make them dance
Make them lose their minds
(Oh yeah)

We got that jam
Make them dance
Make them lose their minds
(Uh huh)

We got that jam
Make them dance
Make them lose their minds
Yeah, yeah, yeah''''''''''''''''
