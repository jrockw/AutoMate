Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?

Hold up, wait - before you go, just stay,
And talk to me for a little, baby, won't you loosen up just a little?
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Hold up, wait - shut up and kiss me, babe;
I just wanna get a little taste, I just wanna get a little taste before you go...
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Time and my trust - don't mess this up!
(You got me falling in love, you got me falling in love, you got me falling so hard...)
Boy, you change the way I breathe when you put your lips on me - I adore you,
So let me make it clear to you that, boy, you're all I need...
Oh, baby...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time... (Baby!)
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
